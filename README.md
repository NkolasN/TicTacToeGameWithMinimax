# A Tic-Tac-Toe game against a minimax AI player

A simple implementation of a tic-tac-toe game where the player competes against a Minimax AI player.
The goal of the minimax algorithm is to minimise the maximum score of the other player. Given enough
tree search depth, the AI should never lose. The game will always end up as a draw or with the AI winning

<b> Note: </b> There seems to be an issue with the mouse click detection mechanism under windows but on Linux it works fine
